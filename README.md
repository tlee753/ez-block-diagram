# EZ Block Diagram
Embeddable, Zoomable Block Diagram

This is a organization tool idea that has been floating around in my head for awhile. Basically, I have all these projects with structures that I want to communicate in an easy to understand block diagram. I have been doing this for years now with Gravit Designer (huge shout out: [designer.io](https://designer.io) which looks great but can take a few minutes to produce and it generates an image which must be re-generated and replaced with every change. My goal is to create a simple json file that can quickly be edited to create a block diagram with the added benefits of being able to zoom in (a la Prezi) and be able to easily embed it into a web page.

Obvious choice here is to use javascript (web dev, dynamic elements, easily embedable, static web content) and the canvas element seemed like a good starting point. A pinch of w3 schools and now I am well on my way...
